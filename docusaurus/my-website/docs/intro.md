# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover how a brand new **BNB Greenfield Monitoring System works**. In this tutorial you will learn how **BNB Greenfield Monitoring System** acquires official BNB Greenfield Data in real time and how to set up this project on your local machine.

## Getting Started

Get started by cloning the repository **[link](https://github.com/zaurbbb/front-hahaton/tree/front)**.
After that you will be provided with source code and other required files.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- Nvigate to the project folder by using **cd** command
```bash
cd ./"type project name here"
```
- After you have successfully navigated to the project folder open the terminal and type the following:
```bash
npm i
```
or
```bash
npm install
```
This will make sure that all the dependencies are completely installed and the project will run successfully.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.
